For homework 1, I generated 100 samples of different sizes. Then I used several diffenrent distribution functions to plot the distribution.
For homework 2, I downloaded the data of citibike. I was trying to figure out if there is a relationship between the age of users and the trip duration. I proposed the Null Hypothesis and the Alternative Hypothesis. Then I cleaned up the data so that it is ready to be use.
For homework3, I calculated the mean of the dataset, then I use the Z test function to find out if the Null Hypothesis is rejected or not.
